# MongoDB Model Design

## Polymorphic Pattern

### Introduction

MongoDB’s polymorphic schema allows for storing different types of documents in the same collection and adding new types of documents without affecting existing ones.

### Pros and Cons

Pros:

- It is **convenient** to store documents of **different types in the same collection** without needing to pre-define the schema of the collection.
- Allowing the use of **the same set of APIs** to handle different types of documents makes for **simpler usage**.
- Allowing retrieval of **multiple types** of documents in **a single query** significantly **reduces query time**
- Storing different types of documents in the same collection can **reduce the storage space** needed for **indexing** and avoid creating multiple collections for different document types.

Cons:

1. Switching between **different types** of data leads to **some performance loss**
2. There may be a problem when **querying a collection** that contains some documents with **a specific field** while others do not have that field
3. If you need to add **a new type** of document, you may need to modify **the program** to accommodate the new type.
4. Due to the need for **type conversion**, there may also be **an increase in code complexity** and the possibility of errors.

### Example

#### In Mongosh

 Connect to MongoDB

```bash
$ systemctl start mongod.service

$ mongosh

$ use model
```

Insert the following data.

```json
$ db.model.insertMany([{
    "name": "Savannah",
    "landAnimals": [
        {
            "name": "Lion"
        },
        {
            "name": "Zebra"
        },
        {
            "name": "Giraffe"
        }
    ]
},
{
    "name": "Coral Reef",
    "aquaticAnimals": [
        {
            "name": "Clownfish"
        },
        {
            "name": "Starfish"
        },
        {
            "name": "Seahorse"
        }
    ]
}])

```

delete the data
```json
$ db.model.deleteMany({ $or: [{ name: "Savannah" }, { name: "Coral Reef" }] })
```

#### In Golang

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options"
)

/*
Define the structure for the data model,
including optional fields for land and aquatic animals
*/
type model struct {
	Name           string          `bson:"name"`
	LandAnimals    []LandAnimal    `bson:"landAnimals,omitempty"`
	AquaticAnimals []AquaticAnimal `bson:"aquaticAnimals,omitempty"`
}


// Define the structure for land animals
type LandAnimal struct {
	Name string `bson:"name"`
}

// Define the structure for aquatic animals
type AquaticAnimal struct {
	Name string `bson:"name"`
}

func main() {
	// Establish a connection to the MongoDB instance
	clientOptions := options.Client().ApplyURI("mongodb://localhost:27017")
	client, err := mongo.Connect(context.Background(), clientOptions)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
    defer client.Disconnect(context.Background())

	// Verify that the connection was successful
	err = client.Ping(context.Background(), nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Connected to MongoDB!")

	// Get a handle to the "model" collection within the "model" database
	modelCollection := client.Database("model").Collection("polymorphic")

	// Insert two documents into the collection, each with a different set of animals
	_, err = modelCollection.InsertMany(context.Background(), []interface{}{
        // First document with land animals
		model{
			Name: "Savannah",
			LandAnimals: []LandAnimal{
				{Name: "Lion"},
				{Name: "Zebra"},
				{Name: "Giraffe"},
			},
		},
        // Second document with aquatic animals
		model{
			Name: "Coral Reef",
			AquaticAnimals: []AquaticAnimal{
				{Name: "Clownfish"},
				{Name: "Starfish"},
				{Name: "Seahorse"},
			},
		},
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Data inserted successfully!")

	// Query the collection for the documents that match the specified filter (by name)
    filter := bson.M{"name": bson.M{"$in": []string{"Savannah", "Coral Reef"}}}
	cur, err := modelCollection.Find(context.Background(), filter)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer cur.Close(context.Background())
    
    /*
        Iterate over the cursor and decode each document into a "model" object,
        adding it to a slice of models
    */
	var models []model
	for cur.Next(context.Background()) {
		var model model
		err := cur.Decode(&model)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		models = append(models, model)
	}
	if err := cur.Err(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Data queried successfully: %v\n", models)

	// Delete all documents that match the specified filter
	_, err = modelCollection.DeleteMany(context.Background(), filter)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Data deleted successfully!")
}
```

## Subset Pattern

### Introduction

**The subset pattern** is a way to solve **the problem of the working set exceeding RAM**. This allows the working set to be reduced by introducing only a part or subset of the overall data.

For example

Suppose an e-commerce website has a product review list.

When accessing the product data, we are likely to only need **the most recent 10 or so reviews**. Instead of storing all the reviews with the product, we can divide them into two collections.

One collection has **the main data of the product**.

The other collection has **less frequently used review data.**

### Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Reduces **the number of queries** and retrieves all necessary data at once.
- Maintains **data consistency** and avoids issues with invalid or out-of-sync references.
- Can use **indexing** and aggregation functions to quickly process embedded documents.

Cons:

- Must update or delete data in **another collection** synchronously.
- Stores partially **duplicated data** in two collections.
- Need to ensure that data in the subset is **synchronized with data in another collection**.

### Example

#### In Mongosh

##### Step1:

Creates a products collection in a database and inserts two documents representing products with their details and reviews

```json
// Creates a new collection called products
$ db.createCollection("products")

// Inserts multiple documents into the products collection 
$ db.products.insertMany([
  {
    name: "iPhone 14",
    price: 999,
    description: "iPhone 14 is the latest smartphone from Apple, featuring a powerful A16 processor, a high-resolution OLED screen, an innovative Face ID technology and wireless charging.",
    category: "phone",
    reviews: [
      {
        name: "Zhang San",
        content: "This is the best phone I have ever used, fast, clear, functional, highly recommended!",
        rating: 5
      },
      {
        name: "Li Si",
        content: "This phone is pretty good, but the battery life is not enough, I hope the next generation can improve.",
        rating: 4
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    name: "AirPods Pro",
    price: 249,
    description: "AirPods Pro are wireless noise-canceling headphones from Apple, featuring active noise cancellation, transparency mode, adaptive EQ and spatial audio, letting you enjoy a high-quality listening experience.",
    category: "headphone",
    reviews: [
      {
        name: "Wang Wu",
        content: "These headphones are really great, the noise cancellation is very good, the sound quality is also very clear, and they are very comfortable.",
        rating: 5
      },
      {
        name: "Zhao Liu",
        content: "These headphones are okay, but the price is a bit expensive, and they are easy to fall off.",
        rating: 3
      }
    ]
  }
])
```

Response

```json
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedIds: {
    '0': ObjectId("643401169147cacadb0f37d1"), // This is the _id of iPhone 14
    '1': ObjectId("643401169147cacadb0f37d2") // This is the _id of AirPods Pro
  }
}

```

##### Step2:

Creates a reviews collection in a database and inserts four documents representing reviews with their details

The ObjectId was copied from the previous command !

```json
// Creates a new collection called reviews
$ db.createCollection("reviews")

// Inserts multiple documents into the reviews collection
$ db.reviews.insertMany([
  {
    product_id: ObjectId("643401169147cacadb0f37d1"), // This is the _id of iPhone 14 (This was copied from the previous command.)
    name: "Zhang San",
    content: "This is the best phone I have ever used, fast, clear, functional, highly recommended!",
    rating: 5
  },
  {
    product_id: ObjectId("643401169147cacadb0f37d1"), // This is the _id of iPhone 14 (This was copied from the previous command.)
    name: "Li Si",
    content: "This phone is pretty good, but the battery life is not enough, I hope the next generation can improve.",
    rating: 4
  },
  {
    product_id: ObjectId("643401169147cacadb0f37d2"), // This is the _id of AirPods Pro (This was copied from the previous command.)
    name: "Wang Wu",
    content: "These headphones are really great, the noise cancellation is very good, the sound quality is also very clear, and they are very comfortable.",
    rating: 5
  },
  {
    product_id: ObjectId("643401169147cacadb0f37d2"), // This is the _id of AirPods Pro (This was copied from the previous command.)
    name: "Zhao Liu",
    content: "These headphones are okay, but the price is a bit expensive, and they are easy to fall off.",
    rating: 3
  }
])
```

##### Step3:

Creates, retrieves and drops indexes on the products collection

```json
// Creates an index on the name field of the products collection
$ db.products.createIndex({name: 1})

// Retrieves a list of all indexes on the products collection
$ db.products.getIndexes()
[
  { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
  { v: 2, key: { name: 1 }, name: 'name_1' }
]

// Drops the index called name_1 from the products collection
$ db.products.dropIndex("name_1")

// Retrieves a list of all indexes on the products collection
$ db.products.getIndexes()
[
  { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
]
```

##### Step4:

Joins data from reviews and products collections and returns the execution time

```json
$ db.products.aggregate([ { $lookup: { from: "reviews", localField: "_id", foreignField: "product_id", as: "reviews2" } }]).explain("executionStats").executionStats.executionTimeMillis
1
```

##### Step5:

Joins data from reviews and products collections

```json
$ db.products.aggregate([
  {$lookup: {
    from: "reviews",
    localField: "_id",
    foreignField: "product_id",
    as: "reviews2"
  }}
])
```

Response

Note that both the reviews and reviews2 arrays have content !

```json

## Bucket Pattern

### Introduction



```bash
```





### Use bucket Index



```bash

$ mongosh

$ use test

$ db.createCollection("products")

$ for (let i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
   db.products.insertOne({
      name: "product" + i,
      price: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)   //随机价格1-1000
   })
}

$ db.products.createIndex(
   { price: 1 }, 
   { bucketSize: 50 }
)  
```
